Chameleon Internationalization
==============================

.. note:: This recipe was created to document the process of internationalization
   (i18n) and localization (l10n) of chameleon templates. There is not much to
   it, really, but as the author was baffled by this fact, it seems a good idea
   to describe the few necessary steps.

We start off with a virtualenv and a fresh Pyramid project created via paster:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
   $ env/bin/pip install pyramid
   $ env bin/paster create -t pyramid_routesalchemy ChameleonI18n


Dependencies
------------

First, add dependencies to your Pyramid project's ``setup.py``::

   requires = [
       ...
       'Babel',
       'lingua',
       ]
   ...
   message_extractors = { '.': [
       ('**.py',   'lingua_python', None ),
       ('**.pt',   'lingua_xml', None ),
       ]},


You will have to run ``../env/bin/python setup.py develop`` after this to get
Babel and lingua into your virtualenv and make the message extraction work.

A Folder for the locales
------------------------

Next, add a folder for the locales POT & PO files:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   $ mkdir chameleoni18n/locale


What to translate
-----------------

Well, let's translate some parts of the given template ``mytemplate.pt``. Add a
namespace and an i18n:domain to the <html> tag:

.. code-block:: text

   -<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" xmlns:tal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal">
   +<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" xmlns:tal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal"
   +      xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
   +      i18n:domain="ChameleonI18n">


The important bit -- the one the author was missing -- is that the i18n:domain
must be spelled exactely like the POT/PO/MO files created later on, including
case. Without this, the translations will not be picked up.

So now we can mark a part of the template for translation:

.. code-block:: text

   -          <h2>Search documentation</h2>
   +          <h2 i18n:translate="search_documentation">Search documentation</h2>

The i18n:translate attribute tells lingua to extract the contents of the h2 tag
to the catalog POT. You don't have to add a description (like in this example
'search_documentation'), but it makes it easier for translators.


Commands for Translations
-------------------------

Now you need to run these commands in your project's directory:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   (env)$ python setup.py extract_messages
   (env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l de
   (env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l fr
   (env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l es
   (env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l it
   (env)$ python setup.py update_catalog
   (env)$ python setup.py compile_catalog

Repeat the ``init_catalog`` step for each of the langauges you need.

The first command will extract the strings for translation to your projects
locale/<project-name>.pot file, in this case ChameleonI18n.pot

The ``init`` commands create new catalogs for different languages and the
``update`` command will sync entries from the main POT to the languages POs.


At this point you can tell your translators to go edit the po files :-)
Otherwise the translations will remain empty and defaults will be used.


Finally, the ``compile`` command will translate the POs to binary MO files
that are actually used to get the relevant translations.

.. note::

   The gettext sub-directory of your project is ``locale/`` in Pyramid, and
   not ``i18n/`` as it was in Pylons. You'll notice that in the default
   setup.cfg of a Pyramid project, which has all the necessary settings to
   make the above commands work without parameters.


Add locale directory to projects config
---------------------------------------

At this point you'll also need to add your local directory to your
project's configuration::

    def main(...):
       ...
       config.add_translation_dirs('YOURPROJECT:locale')


where YOURPROJECT in our example would be 'chameleoni18n'.


Set a default locale
--------------------

You can now change the default locale for your project in ``development.ini``
and see if the translations are being picked up.

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   -  pyramid.default_locale_name = en
   +  pyramid.default_locale_name = de

Of course, you need to have edited your relevant PO file and added a
translation of the relevant string, in this example ``search_documentation``
and have the PO file compiled to a MO file. Now you can fire up you app and
check out the translated headline.
