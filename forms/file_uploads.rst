File Uploads
%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are two parts necessary for handling file uploads.  The first is to
make sure you have a form that's been setup correctly to accept files.  This
means adding ``enctype`` attribute to your ``form`` element with the value of
``multipart/form-data``.  A very simple example would be a form that accepts
an mp3 file.  Notice we've setup the form as previously explained and also
added an ``input`` element of the ``file`` type.

.. code-block:: html
    :linenos:

    <form action="/store_mp3_view" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8"
          enctype="multipart/form-data">

        <label for="mp3">Mp3</label>
        <input id="mp3" name="mp3" type="file" value="" />

        <input type="submit" value="submit" />
    </form>

The second part is handling the file upload in your view callable (above,
assumed to answer on ``/store_mp3_view``).  The uploaded file is added to the
request object as a ``cgi.FieldStorage`` object accessible through the
``request.POST`` multidict.  The two properties we're interested in are the
``file`` and ``filename`` and we'll use those to write the file to disk.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    import os
    import uuid
    from pyramid.response import Response

    def store_mp3_view(request):
        # ``filename`` contains the name of the file in string format.
        #
        # WARNING: this example does not deal with the fact that IE sends an
        # absolute file *path* as the filename.  This example is naive; it
        # trusts user input.

        filename = request.POST['mp3'].filename

        # ``input_file`` contains the actual file data which needs to be
        # stored somewhere.

        input_file = request.POST['mp3'].file

        # Note that we are generating our own filename instead of trusting
        # the incoming filename since that might result in insecure paths.
        # Please note that in a real application you would not use /tmp,
        # and if you write to an untrusted location you will need to do
        # some extra work to prevent symlink attacks.

        file_path = os.path.join('/tmp', '%s.mp3' % uuid.uuid4())

        # We first write to a temporary file to prevent incomplete files from
        # being used.

        temp_file_path = file_path + '~'
        output_file = open(temp_file_path, 'wb')

        # Finally write the data to a temporary file file
        input_file.seek(0)
        while True:
            data = input_file.read(2<<16)
            if not data:
                break
            output_file.write(data)

        # If your data is really critical you may want to force it to disk first
        # using output_file.flush(); os.fsync(output_file.fileno())

        output_file.close()

        # Now that we know the file has been fully saved to disk move it into place.

        os.rename(temp_file_path, file_path)

        return Response('OK')
