Getting Started with Pyramid
============================

Pyramid is a web framework for Python 2 and 3. This tutorial gives a
Python 2/3-compatible, high-level tour of the major features.

This hands-on tutorial covers "a little about a lot": practical
introductions to the most common facilities. Fun, fast-paced, and most
certainly not aimed at experts.

TODO
====

- Change WikiPage to Page, wikipage to page
- Discuss imperative and declarative styles for config
- Get rid of multi-line imports
- Check with Python 2.7
- Test Python config with from sqlite3 import *
