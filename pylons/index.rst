This guide discusses how Pyramid 1.3 differs from Pylons 1, and a few ways to
make it more like Pylons. The guide may also be helpful to readers coming from
Django or another Rails-like framework. The author has been a Pylons developer
since 2007. The examples are based on Pyramid's default SQLAlchemy application
and on the Akhet_ demo. 

If you haven't used Pyramid yet you can read this guide to get an overview of
the differences and the Pyramid API. However, to actually start using Pyramid
you'll want to read at least the first five chapters of the `Pyramid
manual`_ (through `Creating a Pyramid Project`_) and go through the Tutorials_.
Then you can come back to this guide to start designing your application, and
skim through the rest of the manual to see which sections cover which topics.
