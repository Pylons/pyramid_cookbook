Debugging

Using PDB to Debug Your Application
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``pdb`` is an interactive tool that comes with Python, which allows you to
break your program at an arbitrary point, examine values, and step through
code.  It's often much more useful than print statements or logging
statements to examine program state.  You can place a ``pdb.set_trace()``
statement in your Pyramid application at a place where you'd like to examine
program state.  When you issue a request to the application, and that point
in your code is reached, you will be dropped into the ``pdb`` debugging
console within the terminal that you used to start your application.

There are lots of great resources that can help you learn PDB.

- Doug Hellmann's PyMOTW blog entry entitled "pdb - Interactive Debugger" at
  http://blog.doughellmann.com/2010/09/pymotw-pdb-interactive-debugger.html
  is the canonical text resource to learning PDB.

- The PyCon video presentation by Chris McDonough entitled "Introduction to
  PDB" at http://pyvideo.org/video/644/introduction-to-pdb is a good place to
  start learning PDB.

- The video at http://marakana.com/forums/python/python/423.html shows you
  how to start how to start to using pdb.  The video describes using ``pdb``
  in a command-line program.

Below is a debugging scenario using PDB to debug Pyramid.

Debugging Pyramid
+++++++++++++++++

This tutorial provides a brief introduction to using the python
debugger (``pdb``) for debugging pyramid applications.

This scenario assume you've created a Pyramid project already.  The scenario
assumes you've created a Pyramid project named ``buggy`` using the
``alchemy`` scaffold.

Introducing PDB
---------------

- This single line of python is your new friend::

    import pdb;  pdb.set_trace()

- As valid python, that can be inserted practically anywhere in a Python
  source file.  When the python interpreter hits it - execution will be
  suspended providing you with interactive control from the parent TTY.

PDB Commands
------------

- pdb exposes a number of standard interactive debugging
  commands, including::

    Documented commands (type help <topic>):

Debugging Our ``buggy`` App
---------------------------

- Back to our demo ``buggy`` application we generated from the ``alchemy``
  scaffold, lets see if we can learn anything debugging it.

- The traversal documentation describes how pyramid first acquires a root
  object, and then descends the resource tree using the ``__getitem__`` for
  each respective resource.

Huh?
----

- Let's drop a pdb statement into our root factory object's ``__getitem__``
  method and have a look.  Edit the project's ``models.py`` and add the
  aforementioned ``pdb`` line in ``MyModel.__getitem__``::

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
        session = DBSession()
        # ...

- Restart the Pyramid application, and request a page.  Note the request
  requires a path to hit our break-point::

    http://localhost:6543/   <- misses the break-point, no traversal
    http://localhost:6543/1  <- should find an object
    http://localhost:6543/2  <- does not

- For a very simple case, attempt to insert a missing key by default.  Set
  item to a valid new MyModel in ``MyRoot.__getitem__`` if a match isn't
  found in the database::

        item = session.query(MyModel).get(id)
        if item is None:
            item = MyModel(name='test %d'%id, value=str(id))  # naive insertion

- Move the break-point within the if clause to avoid the false positive hits::

        if item is None:
            import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
            item = MyModel(name='test %d'%id, value=str(id))  # naive insertion

- Run again, note multiple request to the same id continue to create
  new MyModel instances.  That's not right!

- Ah, of course, we forgot to add the new item to the session.  Another line
  added to our ``__getitem__`` method::

        if item is None:
            import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
            item = MyModel(name='test %d'%id, value=str(id))
            session.add(item)

- Restart and test.  Observe the stack; debug again.  Examine the item
  returning from MyModel::

    (pdb) session.query(MyModel).get(id)

- Finally, we realize the item.id needs to be set as well before adding::

        if item is None:
            item = MyModel(name='test %d'%id, value=str(id))
            item.id = id
            session.add(item)

- Many great resources can be found describing the details of using
  pdb.  Try the interactive ``help`` (hit 'h') or a search engine near
  you.

.. note:: There is a well known bug in ``PDB`` in UNIX, when user cannot 
  see what he is typing in terminal window after any interruption during 
  ``PDB`` session (it can be caused by ``CTRL-C`` or when the server restarts 
  automatically). This can be fixed by launching any of this commands in broken 
  terminal: ``reset``, ``stty sane``. Also one can add one of this commands into
  ``~/.pdbrc`` file, so they will be launched before ``PDB`` session::

          from subprocess import Popen
          Popen(["stty", "sane"])
