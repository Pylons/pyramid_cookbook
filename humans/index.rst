Tutorial: Pyramid for Humans
============================

Pyramid has emerged as a fast, modern, lightweight web
framework for the Pylons and Zope communities. When you just need a
web app, and not a full CMS, Pyramid lets you retain many of the same
Plone technologies or start from scratch.

This hands-on tutorial covers a little about a lot: practical
introductions to the most common facilities.  Fun, fast-paced, and
most certainly not aimed at experts.

Approach
========

The tutorial is broken into major areas, starting with constructing a
dummy UI/UX. Each major area is then broken into a series of steps in
which a very small number of concepts is introduced in each step.
Working code is gradually built up.

As explained in the scenario, the sample application is a project
management system for multiple companies with multiple projects. We
chose traversal and ZODB as the primary architecture for this tutorial.
