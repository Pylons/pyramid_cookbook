Must-have pre-alpha-1
=====================

Features
--------

- Release deform2 (merge deform_bootstrap).

- Use hasattr(__is_folder__) instead of IFolder.providedBy in is_folder.

- Use is_folder view predicate instead of context=IFolder in folder views
  (holdup is testing out folder button action overrides in the face of views
  being registered against IFolder).

- Change all mentions of ``context`` to ``resource`` in docs.

- Better error handling in folder contents view when an ajax request fails.

Can wait until after alpha 1
============================

- Ability to more efficiently dump and load blobs.

- Stamp created objects with creator information?

- Add specific configurator directives for object event registrations
  (e.g. config.subscribe_modified).

- Once we depend on Pyramid 1.4b1+, normalize subscriber predicate argument
  lists.

- Add a ``substanced.load_dump`` key for use by root factory.

- Work out OpenID/Twitter/whatever authentication.

- Make statds pipeline so that statistics are sent only once per request

Docs
----

Folder Contents
+++++++++++++++

- Improve narrative documentation about column specifications (including
  sorter).

- Improve narrative documentation about custom buttons and associated views.

Cataloging
++++++++++

- Improve current catalog docs with more info about: catalog index creation,
  content indexing, query API

Misc
++++

- Explain the objectmap get_extents API.

Dump and Load
+++++++++++++

- Add API and narrative docs for dump/load, and dump contexts.


Can Wait Forever (Nice-to-Have)
===============================

- XML-RPC.

- Drag and drop ACE reordering in ACL edit view (note: Paul has this
  somewhere).

- Ability to add and edit principals in existing ACEs in ACL edit view.

- Add a redo button to undo flash messages.

- Show a derivative of output status in flash message when update indexes /
  reindex catalog is done to a catalog.

Probably Bad Ideas
==================

- Create "addable here" API that manages the __sdi_addable__ attribute of a
  folderish object.

- Emit an ObjectMoving event rather than removed event with a moving flag,
  then an add event?

- Create object map management UI (view relationships, view paths, view
  objectids).

- Decide whether to split "manage contents" permissions out for folders into
  add, delete, rename.

- Import/export from folder contents view.

- Specialize recatalog during a rename, so only indexes that are
  context-sensitive are reindexed.

- Catalog event subscriber currently does a hellishly expensive recatalog of
  allowed indexes when an ACL is changed.  Not sure if there's even a general
  way to make this do less work, but could be.

- __viewable__, __renameable__, __deletable__, __copyable__, __duplicatable__
  attributes of contained objects in folder contents view that controls
  how contained object can be acted upon?  E.g.::

    def __viewable__(self, context, request):
        return has_permission('sdi.view', context, request)


Made Irrelevant
===============

- Fix ``Batch`` such that seqlen is a maximum.  Rationale: the sequence that
  the batch receives may be smaller than seqlen due to hidden objects in folder
  contents view (irrelevant because folder contents view is now
  catalog-driven).
