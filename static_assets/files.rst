Serving File Content Dynamically
--------------------------------

Usually you'll use a static view (via "config.add_static_view") to
serve file content that lives on the filesystem.  But sometimes files need to
be composed and read from a nonstatic area, or composed on the fly by view
code and served out (for example, a view callable might construct and return
a PDF file or an image).

By way of example, here's a Pyramid application which serves a single static
file (a jpeg) when the URL ``/test.jpg`` is executed by assigning an open
file object to ``response.app_iter``::

    from pyramid.view import view_config
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.response import Response
    from paste.httpserver import serve

    @view_config(route_name='jpg')
    def test_page(request):
        response = Response(content_type='image/jpeg')
        response.app_iter = open('/home/chrism/groundhog1.jpg', 'rb')
        return response

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        config = Configurator()
        config.add_route('jpg', '/test.jpg')
        config.scan('__main__')
        serve(config.make_wsgi_app())

Basically, assign a file object to ``response.app_iter`` and return the
response.

Serving a Single File from the Root
-----------------------------------

If you need to serve a single file such as ``/robots.txt`` or
``/favicon.ico`` that *must* be served from the root, you cannot use a
static view to do it, as static views cannot serve files from the
root (a static view must have a nonempty prefix such as ``/static``).  To
work around this limitation, create views "by hand" that serve up the raw
file data.  Below is an example of creating two views: one serves up a
``/favicon.ico``, the other serves up ``/robots.txt``.

At startup time, both files are read into memory from files on disk using
plain Python.  A Response object is created for each.  This response is
served by a view which hooks up the static file's URL.

.. code-block::  python
   :linenos:

   # this module = myapp.views

   import os

   from pyramid.response import Response
   from pyramid.view import view_config

   # _here = /app/location/myapp

   _here = os.path.dirname(__file__)

   # _icon = /app/location/myapp/static/favicon.ico

   _icon = open(os.path.join(
                _here, 'static', 'favicon.ico')).read()
   _fi_response = Response(content_type='image/x-icon', 
                           body=_icon)

   # _robots = /app/location/myapp/static/robots.txt

   _robots = open(os.path.join(
                  _here, 'static', 'robots.txt')).read()
   _robots_response = Response(content_type='text/plain',
                               body=_robots)

   @view_config(name='favicon.ico')
   def favicon_view(context, request):
       return _fi_response

   @view_config(name='robots.txt')
   def robotstxt_view(context, request):
       return _robots_response

Root-Relative Custom Static View (URL Dispatch Only)
----------------------------------------------------

The :class:`pyramid.static.static_view` helper class generates a Pyramid view
callable.  This view callable can serve static assets from a directory.  An
instance of this class is actually used by the
:meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_static_view` configuration method, so
its behavior is almost exactly the same once it's configured.

.. warning:: 

   The following example *will not work* for applications that use
   traversal, it will only work if you use URL dispatch
   exclusively.  The root-relative route we'll be registering will always be
   matched before traversal takes place, subverting any views registered via
   ``add_view`` (at least those without a ``route_name``).  A
   :class:`pyramid.static.static_view` cannot be made root-relative when you
   use traversal.

To serve files within a directory located on your filesystem at
``/path/to/static/dir`` as the result of a "catchall" route hanging from the
root that exists at the end of your routing table, create an instance of the
:class:`pyramid.static.static_view` class inside a ``static.py`` file in your
application root as below::

   from pyramid.static import static_view
   www = static_view('/path/to/static/dir', use_subpath=True)

.. note:: For better cross-system flexibility, use an asset
   specification as the argument to :class:`pyramid.static.static_view`
   instead of a physical absolute filesystem path, e.g. ``mypackage:static``
   instead of ``/path/to/mypackage/static``.

Subsequently, you may wire the files that are served by this view up to be
accessible as ``/<filename>`` using a configuration method in your
application's startup code::

   # .. every other add_route and/or add_handler declaration should come
   # before this one, as it will, by default, catch all requests

   config.add_route('catchall_static', '/*subpath', 'myapp.static.www')

The special name ``*subpath`` above is used by the
:class:`pyramid.static.static_view` view callable to signify the path of the
file relative to the directory you're serving.

Basic File Uploads
------------------

There are two parts necessary for handling file uploads.  The first is to
make sure you have a form that's been setup correctly to accept files.  This
means adding ``enctype`` attribute to your ``form`` element with the value of
``multipart/form-data``.  A very simple example would be a form that accepts
an mp3 file.  Notice we've setup the form as previously explained and also
added an ``input`` element of the ``file`` type.

.. code-block:: html
    :linenos:

    <form action="/store_mp3_view" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8"
          enctype="multipart/form-data">

        <label for="mp3">Mp3</label>
        <input id="mp3" name="mp3" type="file" value="" />

        <input type="submit" value="submit" />
    </form>

The second part is handling the file upload in your view callable (above,
assumed to answer on ``/store_mp3_view``).  The uploaded file is added to the
request object as a ``cgi.FieldStorage`` object accessible through the
``request.POST`` multidict.  The two properties we're interested in are the
``file`` and ``filename`` and we'll use those to write the file to disk::

    import os
    from pyramid.response import Response

    def store_mp3_view(request):
        # ``filename`` contains the name of the file in string format.
        #
        # WARNING: this example does not deal with the fact that IE sends an
        # absolute file *path* as the filename.  This example is naive; it
        # trusts user input.

        filename = request.POST['mp3'].filename

        # ``input_file`` contains the actual file data which needs to be
        # stored somewhere.

        input_file = request.POST['mp3'].file

        # Using the filename like this without cleaning it is very
        # insecure so please keep that in mind when writing your own
        # file handling.
        file_path = os.path.join('/tmp', filename)
        output_file = open(file_path, 'wb')

        # Finally write the data to the output file
        input_file.seek(0)
        while 1:
            data = input_file.read(2<<16)
            if not data:
                break
            output_file.write(data)
        output_file.close()

        return Response('OK')
