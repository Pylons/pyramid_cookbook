Let's get our tutorial environment setup. Most of the setup work is in standard
Python development practices: install Python, make an isolated environment, and
setup packaging tools.

The :ref:`Quick Tutorial of Pyramid <pyramid:quick_tutorial>` has an excellent
section covering the :ref:`installation and setup requirements
<pyramid:qtut_requirements>`. Follow those instructions to get Python and
Pyramid setup.
